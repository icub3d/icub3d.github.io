        <p>This last week, I had the opportunity to attend the
<a href="http://www.openwest.org/">OpenWest</a> conference. I can&rsquo;t say enough
about how amazing it was. If you have the opportunity next year to
attend, you should definitely do it! During the conference, I was able
to <a href="http://joind.in/talk/view/8316">present</a> on some of my recent blog
posts. I was also able to attend a session and a keynote from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf">Rasmus Lerdorf</a> and many
other really smart people. I felt like everyone came together with a
common goal of sharing the knowledge they had and learning from the
experience of others.</p>

<p>If I had to list the most important thing I got out of it, it would be
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel.&rdquo; As is the case with many hackers, I often
find myself with a chip on my shoulder. I see some open source program
or piece of code and immediately think, &ldquo;I could do it better.&rdquo; The
reality is that while I might be able to do it better, the time and
effort involved in doing it better takes time away from bringing my
own new ideas to fruition.</p>

<p>While there are cases where it&rsquo;s worthwhile to rewrite something
yourself, they definitely should not be a regular part of your
programming. The beauty of open source software is that we can
leverage the work that someone else has already done. This enables us
to make our ideas reality at a faster pace than in the proprietary
world.</p>

<p>The goal of my presentation was to provide a perfect example of
this. By leveraging the work already done by really smart people, I
was able to take an <a href="https://github.com/icub3d/home">idea</a> (albeit a
small one) and have a working concept in just a couple of weekends
worth of work. If I had tried to do the same project without
<a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, and
<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a> it would have
easily taken months.</p>

<p>In the open source world we have the opportunity to stand on the
shoulders of
giants<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants">1</a></sup>. Let&rsquo;s
use that opportunity to our advantage and accelerate the rate of
innovation.</p>
