        <p>Last week in my <a href="http://plug.org/">local Linux user group</a> mailing
list the topic of static blogging came up. I had been thinking of
converting my blog over, but wasn&rsquo;t sure which one I&rsquo;d prefer to
use. One of the responses to my inquiry was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been looking for a project with which to learn a new
language, writing your own blog engine is a reasonable choice.  The
&lsquo;market&rsquo; is already hopelessly polluted with toy blog engines, which
is evidence for its suitability as a learning project.  Most of what
makes a blog memorable has absolutely nothing to do with the
back-end software, anyway.  If you are feeling ambitious, you could
write a blog engine <em>and</em> your own Markdown parser with custom
extensions
(<a href="http://plug.org/pipermail/plug/2013-January/029154.html">Pearson, 2013</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t normally find myself with much time on my hands. I have two
young children, school, a full-time job, and now a sister-in-law with
crutches in the home. Misfortune (or fortune I suppose) befell me this
weekend though and my son gave me a terrible cold. I was out of
commission for the entire weekend.</p>

<p>You can only watch so much
<a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/series/psych/">Psych</a> and
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/downtonabbey/">Downton Abbey</a>, so
I took upon myself the challenge of writing my own static blog
application as suggested. Without further guilding the lilies, here
it is: <a href="https://github.com/icub3d/goblog">goblog</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so daring, that I&rsquo;ve even used it already to convert my existing
blog at blogger into a static blog and I&rsquo;ve hosted it using
appengine. If you are reading this, I can say that the software
worked! What&rsquo;s nice about this all is that it&rsquo;s still
free. <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> can host the code and I don&rsquo;t
imagine myself exceeding the free limits of
<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">appengine</a>.</p>

<p>It is certainly rough around the edges, but I was surprised what I
could accomplish over a weekend while heavily medicated. I attribute a
lot of the success to the tools already available to me. Go provides a
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/">template package</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/russross/blackfriday">Russ Ross</a> already had a
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> parser. The
front-end is simply <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">bootstrap</a>,
<a href="http://jquery.com/">jquery</a>, and
<a href="http://craig.is/making/rainbows">rainbow</a>. It was merely a matter
putting the pieces together.</p>

<p>You can see a completed working example with my own
<a href="http://joshua.themarshians.com/">blog</a> which originates from a
<a href="https://github.com/icub3d/joshua.themarshians.com">project on github</a>. It
works great for me, but I&rsquo;d be happy to entertain requests for
changes. I tried to keep it simple, so it expects you to design the
templates yourself but I imagine most DIY bloggers would want that
anyway. All I do now to publish is:</p>

<pre><code>$ goblog
$ appcfg.py update joshua.themarshians.com
</code></pre>

<p>Overall, it was a fun weekend for me and not just because of the
codeine. I can&rsquo;t say that I was a novice at Go, but I did learn a lot
and hope to use the project as a springboard for more learning. I
still need to add unit tests, improve the documentation, etc. All of
those are sure to increase my knowledge of Go.</p>
