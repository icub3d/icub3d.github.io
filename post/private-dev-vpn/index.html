<p>Recently, I wanted to setup a private development environment for my
home. Public places like <a href="https://slack.com/">slack</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/">github</a>, etc. are great for open source
development and enterprise teams. It can be expensive to pay for some
of their services though if you are on a small team or do side work
here and there. For me, spending a few hundred dollars on a cheap
computer (I went with a NUC), allowed me to setup all the services I
needed for a small team that would quickly pay for itself. Over the
next several posts I&rsquo;ll explain how I did it all with open source
software and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a>. I was able to get up a
git repo (<a href="https://gogs.io/">gogs</a>), a CI system
(<a href="https://github.com/drone/drone">drone</a>), and much more running in
just a few days.</p>

<p>One note before we get started, I did all of this on an
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> system so many of the tools
are recent versions. For example, I used Docker 1.10.1 which may
have features that other linux distro&rsquo;s may not have with their canned
docker packages. If you have problems running some of the commands,
try installing the newer versions of the tools or adapting the
commands to fit your version.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with setting up <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a>. I
wanted to be able to get access to the various services I&rsquo;d be setting
up remotely without exposing them to the greater public. It turns out
others have already done some great work in simplifying this
process. Much of my work below is adapted from the instructions at
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kylemanna/openvpn/">kylemann/openvpn</a>&rsquo;s
docker hub page.</p>

<h1 id="server-initialization">Server Initialization</h1>

<p>The first thing we want to do is create a docker volume to store our
configuration and key data.</p>

<pre><code>docker volume create --name openvpn-data
</code></pre>

<p>This will make it simpler to backup your data (as we&rsquo;ll see in a later
post) as well as keep it separate from the actual container. With that
done, we can initialize the configuration file as well as the
certificate store.</p>

<pre><code>docker run -v openvpn-data:/etc/openvpn --rm kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_genconfig -u tcp://HOSTNAME
docker run -v openvpn-data:/etc/openvpn --rm -it kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_initpki
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, you&rsquo;ll want to change <em>HOSTNAME</em> with the external DNS name
that will be used to connect to this server. Also, in my case, I used
TCP because OpenVPN seemed to be mistaking packets that are resent
over the cellular network as a replay attack. Some googling suggested
that configuration changes could fix this, but I felt like just using
TCP would be fine for my case.</p>

<h1 id="server-configuration">Server Configuration</h1>

<p>Before you start the service you may want to modify the configuration
information. You can do this by creating a docker container that has
your favorite editor and including the volume for the <em>openvpn-data</em>
or you can simply edit the files in
_/var/lib/docker/volumes/openvpn-data/<em>data/</em>. In the file
_ovpn<em>env.sh</em>, you&rsquo;ll want to make a few changes:</p>

<pre><code>declare -x OVPN_CN=&quot;HOSTNAME&quot;
declare -x OVPN_PROTO=&quot;tcp&quot;
declare -ax OVPN_ROUTES='([0]=&quot;X.X.X.0/24&quot;)'
declare -x OVPN_SERVER=&quot;X.X.X.0/24&quot;
declare -x OVPN_SERVER_URL=&quot;tcp://HOSTNAME&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <em>X.X.X</em> with the subnet of your local network and <em>HOSTNAME</em>
with the external DNS entry. Next, you can modify the <em>openvpn.conf</em>
to suit your needs. Here were some notable changes I made:</p>

<pre><code>server X.X.X.192 255.255.255.192
user nobody
group nogroup
push dhcp-option DNS X.X.X.1
push route X.X.X.0 255.255.255.0
</code></pre>

<p>Again, replace <em>X.X.X</em> with your local subnet. I chose the server IP
and mask because I have my local DHCP server setup to give local
addresses between 2 and 192. Using this server configuration, openvpn
will setup a tunnel on the address X.X.X.193 and give IP Addresses
between 194 and 255.</p>

<p>If you have a different DNS server, you&rsquo;ll want to change the value
above, but my local DNS server is the same as my router and yours is
probably the same. This allows me to setup things like <em>git.HOSTNAME</em>
locally and have it resolve when connected to the VPN. The route push
is also important because it tells the client to send all traffic
destined for our local subnet to use the VPN.</p>

<h1 id="ip-forwarding">IP Forwarding</h1>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that many systems don&rsquo;t allow IP packets
to be forwarded, which means openvpn won&rsquo;t work. You can enable this
using sysctl but systemd won&rsquo;t adhere to it. If you are using systemd,
you may have to enable it explicitly. For me, I created the following
file and restarted networking:</p>

<pre><code># cat /etc/systemd/network/eno1.network
[Match]
Name=eno1

[Network]
DHCP=yes
IPForward=yes
</code></pre>

<h1 id="running">Running</h1>

<p>Ok, we are ready to start the container now. Here is the command line I used:</p>

<pre><code>docker run  -v openvpn-data:/etc/openvpn -d -p 1194:1194/tcp --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --restart=always --name=openvpn kylemanna/openvpn
</code></pre>

<p>First, we link to our data volume and expose our port to the
server. Adding the _NET<em>ADMIN</em> capability is necessary because the
container will make a tunnel interface on the host. I love
<em>restart=always</em>. It simplifies starting my services.</p>

<h1 id="network-details">Network Details</h1>

<p>This may be obvious, but there are some networking details to get this
to work. First, your firewall will need to be setup to forward traffic
to your host server on port 1194 (or whatever you configured). I can&rsquo;t
give you specific instructions on doing this for your router but most
of the routers that have a UI section called something like &ldquo;Port
Forwarding&rdquo; that should allow you to do it.</p>

<p>Also, your <em>HOSTNAME</em> value need to be on a public DNS server or it
needs to be your public IP Address. In my case, I have a static IP
address, so I was able to simply add a DNS entry on my public DNS
server. If you&rsquo;re IP Address is not static you can try using a dynamic
DNS service like <a href="http://www.noip.com/">no-ip</a>. You&rsquo;ll then just need
to configure your router to update the IP Address when it changes or
use a service to do it. Many routers these days give you the ability
to update a dynamic DNS entry.</p>

<h1 id="client-configuration">Client Configuration</h1>

<p>In order for a client to connect, we need create certificates for
them. You should do this for each client replacing <em>CLIENT</em> with the
actual client name.</p>

<pre><code>docker run -v openvpn-data:/etc/openvpn --rm -it kylemanna/openvpn easyrsa build-client-full CLIENT nopass
docker run -v openvpn-data:/etc/openvpn --rm kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_getclient CLIENT &gt; CLIENT.ovpn
</code></pre>

<p>In my case, I chose to only do certificate authentication, thus the
<em>nopass</em> option. You can see the docker hub page listed earlier for more
options and how to set a password for clients if you wish.</p>

<p>My Android devices worked out of the box. I simply installed
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.openvpn.openvpn">OpenVPN</a>
and imported the configuration file made from above. My laptop had one
issue though that might be noteworthy. I couldn&rsquo;t get DNS to resolve
out of the box with the configuration. I had to install
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/any/openresolv/">openresolv</a>,
save the shell script
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/masterkorp/openvpn-update-resolv-conf/master/update-resolv-conf.sh">update-resolv-conf.sh</a>
to <em>/etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf.sh</em>, <em>chmod</em> it, and then add this
to the bottom of my configuration:</p>

<pre><code>script-security 2
up /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
down /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
</code></pre>

<p>With that done, it worked great.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Ok, that was a bit involved but if you are at all familiar with
setting up a VPN service, most of it is a review. There are really
just a few commands that might be new which are related to using the
docker container for the service. I&rsquo;ve been really happy with my
setup. Not only do I use it to connect to my local systems but I also
use it when I&rsquo;m on public WiFi to ensure that my surfing is safe.</p>
